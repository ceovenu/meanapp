This is MY app based on the book: MEAN Web Development. by packt

Aug 27.2015: Latest Update: Got up to page 26.
So far I've installed the latest versions of Node and Mongo (I think, globally).
And I've installed Express and Grunt via the package.json file.
I'll worry about Angular when the book gets to it.
